# Pytorch Data Provider for Generating Artificially-Missing Data

The repository is currently work in progress. Its purpose is to generate synthetic datasets with missing values.

## Future work

- [ ] Implement Ampute algorithm from "Generating missing values for simulation purposes: a multivariate amputation procedure" by Schouten et al. (2018)
- [ ] Add additional MNAR tests, e.g. KL-div of a model fitted on observed data and complete data.
